					<h3>Exam Project: Making My Own Website</h3>
					<img src="/C:/Users/Utente/Downloads/reveal.js-master/reveal.js-master/logo.JPG" alt="The Hippie Celiac"></section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Idea</h3>
					<p>The idea for this project was born from my experience both as a celiac and as a travel-enthusiast. I have been a celiac since the age of 10 and travelling is one of the instances when celiacs can really struggle to enjoy their experiences, which is a pity, to say the least. The name "Hippie Celiac" comes from my crafty Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hippie.needles/?hl=en" target="_blank">@hippie.needles</a>.</p>

					<h3>So, What is The Hippie Celiac?</h3>
					<p> It's a blog, a place where celiacs and their friends/family can find guides, tips and resources to make their lives or the lives of the people they love easier and fun!</p>

					<h3>The Development</h3>
					<p>The planning of the website started from the layout and the design. I opted for a minimal, retro style, with contrasting colors and Courier monospace as the main font. I worked on the style of my website in CSS and bootstrap 5 to obtain the desired looks. Then, I designed the logo to match the color palette.</p>

					<h3>The Development</h3>
					<p>I made my website responsive so that it can be functional and visually appealing on any device by using the @media tag and javascript to create a click-on dropdown menu for smaller screens (which took a bit of work, but ended up looking perfect!).</p>

					<h3>The Newsletter</h3>
					<p>Finally, I created a newsletter through Mailchimp and linked it in my html with a script.js, so that it is possible for anyone to subscribe and receive a welcome message in their inbox.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Future Plans</h3>
					<p>As the website says, there is still some content that is not ready. The images on the homepage will become links to the guides that will have reviews with images and links to the places mentioned. Cookies are also a tricky element for me, so I still need to add them to the page (gluten-free ones, obviously). Finally, the SEO of the website and its "meta" section could be refined by adding more elements.</p>
